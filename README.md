# AI_Supernova_Project
My Project for CS0311:
The main files for my code are get_boxes.py, data_parsing.py, and Plot Data.ipynb.
In get_boxes, I parse my data annotations to compile the box data into a single text file.
In data_parsing, I compile my data again and build, train, and test the model.
In Plot Data.ipynb, I make plots to visualize my results using matplotlib

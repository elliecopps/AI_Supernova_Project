# AI_Supernova_Project
My Project for CS0311
The main files for my code are get_boxes.py, data_parsing.py, and Plot Data.ipynb
get_boxes is where I parse my data annotations to compile the box data into a single text file
in data_parsing, I compile my data again and build, train, and test the model.
in Plot Data.ipynb, I make plots to visualize my results using matplotlib
